# Thank You for your Generosity

A fundamental purpose and mission of the Knights of Columbus Lexington Council 94 is **charitable service to our community**, either through volunteer hours or monetary contributions.

We generate our charitable funding through proceeds from the rental of our beautiful Lexington facilities, used for private and public events, plus our annual fundraising events supported by community members like you.

Your donation will help us achieve our charitable mission to:

– Support local families, both our youth and seniors
– Support those with disabilities
– Support our veterans and active duty military
– Aid local students through wellness programs and scholarships

If you are unable to attend fundraising events, or simply wish to make a one-time (or ongoing) donation, please use the following link to access our [Donation Page](https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/donation-form/b172d2ea-91be-4358-b32e-7286e9a392d7)
